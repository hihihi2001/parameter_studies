# Ammonia introduction
## Usage
 * colorless gas with a strong pungent smell
 * boiling point is -33.34 Â°C, but it can be transported unrefrigarated at 10-20 bar
 * in household: cleaning, in the industry its used for: cleaning, disinfecting, explosive, plastic manufacturing...

 Plastics and synthetics
 * most importantly: 80 % of ammonia is used for fertilizers [link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/294579196_Ammonia-fed_fuel_cells_A_comprehensive_review)
 * 4th most common atom in living things (after C, H, O), found in all 20 amino acids building proteins and enzymes, and in the DNA. The first three comes from water and air (CO2), but plants cannot break the triple bond of N2 (except for legumes, like beans, soy, peas, lentils; which live in simbiosis with special bacetrias that can turn N2 into ammonia or nitrate). Natural source is lightning, wich makes nitrogen oxides, later washed into the soil by water. These processes are too slow the replenish farmlands. Note that other nutriuns are used as fertilizer, altought in much smaller quantities and easier to obtain, like phosphorus and potassium
## Production
 * By the end of the 19th century, natural sources of nitrogen fertilizers were depleeting. Spain even waged a war for some guano islands (Chincha Islands War 1865-1879). It was obvius, that the increasing population cannot be sustained.
 * The solution: Fritz Haber, also known as the father of chemical warfare, sold his table sized demonstarion in 1909 to BASF chemical company. 
 Carl Bosch (relative of Robert Bosch, founder of the Bosch company)
 * Haber recieved a nobel price in 1918, Bosch in 1931, and the Haber Bosch process is still the domina  ting ammonia production method today. with only minor improvements
 * Source of **H2**:
 * Source of **N2**: Air, usually cryogenic fractional distillation or pressure swing adsorption, but other methods are available, like burning the oxygen with some hydrogen and then condense the resulting water.
