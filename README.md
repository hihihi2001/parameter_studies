# parameter_studies

## What is this?
This internal repository is meant to be used to synronize parameter studies and related content among multiple workstations. The parameter studies may include hundreds of files (like .csv) and gigabytes of extra data, therefore it should be seperated from the main reository.

## How to use it?
Clone this repository. Make your own branch with your name, as main is protected. Clone [Bubble_dynamics_simulation](https://github.com/hihihi2001/Bubble_dynamics_simulation) into this repository. It should be ignored by git. Do all your work here, and only modify the simulation itself in the inner repository.
